# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? **I felt prepared to face these challenges!**
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? **My workflow is going good and I am starting to build some habits/routines around studying! I've been studying from 6:00am to 7:30am each morning. Since it is a relatively short time block, it is easy for me to stay focused.** 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? **To give myself patience and grace while learning and practicing new concepts.**
